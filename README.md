# Deep learning 
## Before starting
- Windows PyTorch environment configuration see ➡ https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18K411w7Vs/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=76352dd23281e1d6cf59568eae39965d
- Linux PyTorch(Ubuntu) environment(local, I didn't use ssh):
1. Download CUDA, CUdnn, display driver
2. Download Anaconda，create conda environment, Download pytorch
3. Use this environment in Pycharm
## This is a repository about some interesting deep learning models
- Transformer
1. A transformer model that generates text by mimicking novels.
- CNN
1. A CNN model for emotion analysis
- LeNet
